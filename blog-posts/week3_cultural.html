	What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.

	
	The biggest struggle for me so far is allocating enought time to throughly  understand a concept before completeing a challenge or exercise. I find that a lot of times I complete an assignment without really solidifying my understanding of the concepts being taught. Accoring to Georgc's thinking style model, this problem is one that is common within people that share my thinking style. It doesn't help that we only have a limited amount of time to complete and absorb the vast amount of material we are given every week. However, not all hope is lost and reviewing Georgc's theory has helped me to develop strategies to overcome these hurdles.  The first thing I need to do is to skim over all of the assignments and material for the week to get an idea of  what areas are going to require a lot of time and which material I should pay particular attention to. After doing this I should plan out my week and set blocks of time to dedicate to each assignment. I need to be mindful of the fact that reflecting over the concepts I am learning is suppose to be the best way to understand it and be sure to incoporate that reflection time into my plan schedule. The last step is to review and stick to that plan . This will help me to stay focused on one thing at a time instead of multiple things  which is also something I struggle with . Overall the  key to making this plan work is to take a step back and try to identify and remember the bigger picture. My goal is to become a developer and the tasks that I am completeing are designed to help me accomplish this goal. I need to focus more on how what I do will help me achieve my goal and focus less on trivial details along the way .
