<p>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids</p>
<p> These two things, ids and classes, are both selectors used within an  HTML coding file. What they select determines the difference between them. Both of these things are used as tags attatched to specific parts of HTML code and only affect those parts of the code to which they are attatched. Class tags will affect any element sharing the same tag and can be used multiple times in a row . ID's, on the other hand, will only effect the single element to which it is tagged .  </p>
<p> Generally speaking , if there is only  one unique single part of a website that you wish to have affected by certain code, you use the ID tag. However,if there a greater portion of a website that you would like to have all affected by certain code, then use the class tag. For instance, if you would like only one link in a list of them to appear in red - use the ID tag. If you wanted all those links in a list to be red - use the class tag</p>
