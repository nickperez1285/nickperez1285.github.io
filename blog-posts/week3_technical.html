	<h3> Javascript Overview </h3>
<body>
<p>
	Why is JavaScript popular in web development? What are the great things about JavaScript? What are its limitations?
	Javascript is the most popular web programming language of our time. It has been around since the conception of what we know as the "internet" today . The language eventually also became a part of AJAX - the technology that revolutionized internet browsing by allowing web pages's information to be loaded in the background while the acutal pages loaded. . Because Ajax continues to be used today and because javascipt has been used with it and many other servers, Javascript programming laguange now dominates the web programming language world. 
	 Javascipt has many great features. It is integrated within almost every website/page/application online making them more responsive.  It can be used to develop applications both on and off-line. The language syntax is similar to others making it easier to learn. It allows you to create your own functions and methods while having its own set already predefined. Developers can easily access debuggers to help with making scripts. There are also an endless amount of applications that compliment the language making it extremely versatile. 
	 	Despite how useful the language may be , it does contain some limitations. Some older platform technologies never used it and still cannot such as older PDA's and smartphones. It is relatively easy to disable preventing users from accessing certain aspects of a website or application . It has some potential security vulnerabilities such as the same "origin policy" which will allow any script from the same web page to run in ones browser- maliscious or not. Someone logging into a site that appears safe could still be attacked by a virus built into the database .
