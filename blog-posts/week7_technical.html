	<h3> SQL vs NOSQL </h3>
<body>
<p>
As the internet and other web based technologies become more important in our daily lives , the amount of information that gets passed around and stored when using these outlets can become exponentially massive. Providing  a means to  store and manage that data  is extremely important towards making these technologies possible . Databases and the programs  used to operate them have become the popular means of handling this task . Two commonly used databases systems are SQL and NoSQL.

  'SQL' ,or structured query language, has been the database system traditionally used when working with databases and is often what most people first think of to use when attempting to store or retrieve databased information . SQL is the programming language used to define and and manipulate data  stored within a relational database management system . Relational database systems are two-dimensional tables that store  data and information about how that data is related. It can be thought of in the same way as an Excel spreadsheet where the first column contains a subject and proceeding columns contain info about that subject.  Functions built into the SQL language can be used to insert data, query, update and delete, create/modify schemas , and control data access within a given relational database system. 

  "NoSQL", or not only sequel, is a alternative to SQL databasing systems that is used when working with data stored in databases lacking the relational structure typically worked upon with SQL. It refers to the databases themselves , not the language (-hence "No" SQL). NoSQL databases can be used to handle key-value pairs, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores. 

  Both of these systems  are similar in that they are used in the storage ,retrieval, and manipulation of data. The primary difference between the two is the manner in which they perform the prior functions. SQL systems use SQL language to work on SQL databases containing a standard model within which data is stored. NoSQL systems make use of anything outside of the relational database model. Because there is no standard model used, the primary means of manipulating  data within a particular NoSQL database is determined by the system that uses it . If  a NoSQL database uses documents to store its data, its database might have a completely unique function to handle them. 

  Each of these two database systems have their ups and downs. Because SQL uses standard methods to handle and store data it is easier to transfer data between all platforms and persons that use it. Anyone familiar with SQL language will be ale to employ it across any SQL database. Using a standard model also provides and additional level of  accuracy and consistency. Because NoSQL systems typically do not make use of standard methods or models there is some flexibility with regards to how the database physically stores or manipulates data. Without having to adhere to standard data constraints,  NoSQL databases can also be designed to work with more memory intensive data sets.  The downsides of SQL are that it has limited flexibility and options for presenting its data. The downsides of NoSQL are that is lacks support for its systems and that the data it maintains is not always as concise and accurate. 

  Im excited to use SQL. It is very commonly used throughout the developer community and offers consistency in its use and structure. Learning about SQL and its language will enable me to use it on any SQL database. The same cannot be said about Nosql.
