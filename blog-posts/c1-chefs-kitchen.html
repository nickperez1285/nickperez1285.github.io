Based on the video I feel that the experience is designed to make you always feel challenged and never feel too comfortable with regards to the amount of knowledge you think you have. I think its a good set up because it encourages one to always try to do better and never settle . I get the impression that DBC is going to  really test my limits . After watching the video I feel a little bit more comfortable about the environment that DMC tries to create. My only concern is that I tend to ask MANY qustions to solidify concepts being learned and although I know that it is encouraged, I wont know for sure until I actually start going to the physical classes. . My expectations have changed a litte. I realize that this program isnt a pass or fail kind of thing , but rather, its the start of a life long career journey . The program will indeed help me get me ready to enter the workforce , but the skills I will be developing are more focused on making me capable of continuously bettering myself and not just learning a specific curriculum  . It makes me a little nervous because I dont know what the future holds, but Ill just keep taking it day by day and see what happens
