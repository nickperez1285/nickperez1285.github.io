	<h3> Smartphone "Kill Switch" Law </h3>
<body>
<p>
	In today's world just about everyone owns a smartphone . They have become such an integral part of our lives and enable us not only to communicate with each other , but also to gain access to a plethora  of information and applications that help us with our daily life . It is because of these reasons that the value of these items are so high . Like anything else carrying a high price tag, smartphones have become prized targets for thieves on the prowl. Until recently, anyone with the most basic understanding of smartphone technology could wipe a phone clean clearing all of its data and contents, then resell it as if it came straight from the factory. Thankfully, California has become the first state to sign a new law  requiring all smartphone manufacturers to integrate a kill switch function within their phones software. The law  stipulates that future phones must have the ability for owners to remotely lock or  "kill" their phones in the event that it is lost or stolen. This kill switch feature must also be able to prevent phones that are currently locked from being reset back to its default settings as this has been the most common method thieves use to bypass a phones that are  password protected. </p>
	 <p>One might be wondering why only California is the only one adopting this feature into law and not other states. In my opinion , I think California might be the only state that needs to adopt this law in order for the feature to become available nationally. Most smartphone manufacturers like Google and Apple  are based in California  which means that integrating the feature here will most likely also mean that  it will appear on all phones developed and distributed to the rest of the US. It would be extremely cost ineffective for a manufacturer to develop a phone with a feature only available in one state and then have another available for the rest of its consumers . The only other feasible  alternative would be for the manufacturer to develop phones for every state  other than the one where it is headquartered in which is highly unlikely. While the kill switch feature may find its way into states  where there is no legal requirement for it, it is also highly unlikely that such a beneficial feature will meet much protest.
