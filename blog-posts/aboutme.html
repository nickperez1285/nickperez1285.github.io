<p> Greetings world. My name is Nick Perez and I am a new student at devbootcamp. I recently signed up here after spending the last 5-6 months trying to teach myself how to code. Needless to say I couldn't do it on my own .  Thankfully , after telling my parents that  that I might have to live with them a few more years if I couldn't learn this stuff , they were more than willing to invest in my education and get me on track towards becoming a web developer . So here I am now.</p>
<p> 	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I went to Serra in San Mateo for high school , then later attended the University of San Francisco where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies. Having to learn Mandarin as a part of  course requirements was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but I am proud to say it was all worth is as I can now speak it fluently. The skills I developed learning a foreign language are now finding themselves usefull again while studying these various computer languages. </p>
	<p>During college I had an internship with Microsoft which eventually became a full time position as a regional manager after graduating. After spending a year in that role I was invited to take a new postion with the company which I unwisely decided against because it required that I move to Seattle. Since then  I have spent my time trying out different roles with jobs but none them seem to be making me happy.  Then one day I woke up and dedcided I needed to make a completely new kind of career change. It was at this point I decided to become a program developer. </p>
