<center> <h1>Summary</h1></center>
<p> Greetings world. My name is Nick Perez and I am a Full stack Web Developer.</p> 
<p>Just about two years ago I decided that I was going to turn my passion for web development from just a hobby into a full-time career .  The ability to create something meaningful from nothing more than words on a screen fascinates me more than anything else and is why I have chosen to pursue this new career path. </p>
<p>
	Since making the decision to become a developer  I  have dedicated every waking moment  towards learning as much as possible about eveything related to programming and web development . In addition to all of the books and online coding schools, I have also completed a 19-week fulltime web dev bootcamp where I spent anywhere from 10 - 16 hrs a day learning new languages and building various apps. 	 .</p>
<p> 	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I attended Junipero Serra in San Mateo for high school , then later attended the University of San Francisco where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies. Having to learn Mandarin as a part of  course requirements was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but I am proud to say it was all worth is as I can now speak the lanuguage fluently. The skills I developed learning a foreign language are now finding themselves usefull again as I continue learning these computer based languages. </p>
