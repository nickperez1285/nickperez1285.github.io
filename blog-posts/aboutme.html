<center> <h1>Summary</h1></center>
<p> Greetings world. My name is Nick Perez and I am a Full stack Web Developer.</p> 
<p>Just about two  I woke up one day and decided that I was going to turn my passion for web development from just a hobby into a full-time career . I have since dedicated all of my time over the past year and half perfecting my skills through books, online courses, and of course Dev bootcamp. The ability to create something meaningful from nothing more than words on a screen fascinates me and is what drives me to continue to further develop my skills. </p>
<p>
	Since then I  have dedicated every waking moment  towards learning as much as possible about eveything related to programming and web development . In addition to all of the books and online coding schools, I also completed a 19-week fulltime web dev bootcamp where I spent anywhere from 10 - 16 hrs a day learning new languages and building various apps. Over the course of this time I was able to become proficient with : Javascript, Ruby 	 .</p>
<p> 	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I went to Serra in San Mateo for high school , then later attended the University of San Francisco where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies. Having to learn Mandarin as a part of  course requirements was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but I am proud to say it was all worth is as I can now speak it fluently. The skills I developed learning a foreign language are now finding themselves usefull again while studying these various computer languages. </p>
	<p>During college I had an internship with Microsoft which eventually became a full time position as a regional manager after graduating. After spending a year in that role I was invited to take a new postion with the company which I unwisely decided against because it required that I move to Seattle. Since then  I have spent my time trying out different roles with jobs but none them seem to be making me happy.  Then one day I woke up and dedcided I needed to make a completely new kind of career change. It was at this point I decided to become a program developer. </p>
