<h2>About Me </h2> 
<body>
	

<p> Greetings world. My name is Nick Perez and I am a new student to devbootcamp. I recently signed up here after spending the last 5-6 months preparing for AppAcademy.Needless to say I didn't get in. After all that studying and prep work I was able to pass 2/3 final challenges , but unfortunately, even though I solved the problem correctly, I did not pass due to the amount of time I needed to complete it. Having that said I thought all hope was lost as I was truely looking forward to this as a means to a new career. Since I quit my job while getting ready for AppAcademy , I was too low on funds to even consider going to another bootcamp. Thankfully , after telling my parents that I its very possible that I might have to live with them a few more years, they were more than willing to invest in my pursuit of this kind of education . So here I am now.</p>
<p>	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I went to college at the University of San Francisco where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies. Having the learn Mandarin as a part of  course requirements was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but I am proud to say it was all worth is as I am now speak it fluently. During college I had an internship with Microsoft which immediately became a full time position as a  regional manager for one of their marketing programs. After spending a year in that role I was invited to take a new postion with the company in Seattle which I unwisely rejected simply because I did not want to work there. I thought havingh resume filler would enable me to find a job quickly in the Bay Area again . I was wrong. Ive spent the past couple of years doing odd jobs and one day woke up and dedcided I need to make a change. It was at this point I decided to become a program developer. </p>
