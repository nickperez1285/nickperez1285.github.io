<p> Greetings world. My name is Nick Perez and I am a Full stack Web Developer.</p> 
<p>Just over a year ago , out of sheer curiousity, I started  playing around with a coding tutorial for a couple of hours. Those couple of hours soon turned into days filled with more reading material and videos about coding. I became engrossed in my fascination of the whole process of being able to create something meaningful from nothing more than words on a screen. Then one day I built my very own first simple application. It was at that moment that I realized this was my calling and that I was going to try to make a career out of it . </p>
<p>
	Since then I  have dedicated every waking moment  towards learning as much as possible about eveything related to programming and web development . In addition to all of the books and online coding schools, I also completed a 19-week fulltime web dev bootcamp where I spent anywhere from 10 - 16 hrs a day learning new languages and building various apps. Over the course of this time I was able to become proficient with : Javascript, Ruby 	 .</p>
<p> 	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I went to Serra in San Mateo for high school , then later attended the University of San Francisco where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies. Having to learn Mandarin as a part of  course requirements was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but I am proud to say it was all worth is as I can now speak it fluently. The skills I developed learning a foreign language are now finding themselves usefull again while studying these various computer languages. </p>
	<p>During college I had an internship with Microsoft which eventually became a full time position as a regional manager after graduating. After spending a year in that role I was invited to take a new postion with the company which I unwisely decided against because it required that I move to Seattle. Since then  I have spent my time trying out different roles with jobs but none them seem to be making me happy.  Then one day I woke up and dedcided I needed to make a completely new kind of career change. It was at this point I decided to become a program developer. </p>
