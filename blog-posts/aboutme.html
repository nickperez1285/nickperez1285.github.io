<p> Greetings world. My name is Nick Perez and I am a new student at devbootcamp. I recently signed up here after spending the last 5-6 months learning to code on my own. Needless to say I couldn't do it on my own .  Thankfully , after telling my parents that  that I might have to live with them a few more years if I couldn't learn this stuff , they were more than willing to invest my education and get me on track towards becoming a web developer . So here I am now.</p>
<p>	A little more about myself. I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. I went to Serra in San Mateo for high school , then later attended the University of San Francisco where I majored in International Business and minored in Chinese studies. Having to learn Mandarin as a part of  course requirements was by far the hardest thing I had ever done, but I am proud to say it was all worth is as I am now speak it fluently. The skills I developed learning a foreign language are now finding themselves usefull again while studying these various computer languages. During college I had an internship with Microsoft which immediately became a full time position as a  regional manager upon graduating. After spending a year in that role I was invited to take a new postion with the company in Seattle which I unwisely decided against because I was not the biggest fan of the city their. Since then  Ive spent my time doing jobs that seemed to be going nowhere.  Then one day I woke up and dedcided I needed to make a change. It was at this point I decided to become a program developer. </p>
