	<h3> Pairing and Giving Feedback</h3>
<body>
<p>
  Compassion is the primary emotion that comes to mind when reflecting on the pairing experiences I have had so far. I try my best to understand how other are feeling about the material were going through and do what I can to help them either to understand it better or re-frame their perspective on it if they are getting too frustrated. It goes without saying that beginning to code is not easy and can at times be overwhelming. Nobody wants to pair with someone that is impatient or non-cooperative. I feel that it is very important not to forget this because I  wouldn't want anyone to think that they could not ask me for help. All the students in this cohort are going through this same experience together and it always comforts one  to know that we are not alone in our struggles. Once everyone recognizes these things an optimal group dynamic begins to form where everyone feels free to ask for help and to give it when they can .   </p> 
    <p> When it comes to feedback and the notion that we will indefinitely be receiving it from out partners,  one starts to assess how vulnerable they may become and what kind of impact it can have on the progress of the pairing exercise. To this I say just humble yourself and be honest with regards to your understanding of the material. The only way to get accurate feedback is if you allow yourself to interact with your partner in  natural manner. If the fear of receiving negative feedback causes you to act differently , you will never get an accurate assessment as to your true strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore you may prevent yourself from understanding the competencies to their fullest extent. Know that everyone is not perfect and is just as vulnerable in pairing sessions as you are.  
</p>
<p> Going forward I think we all should take an empathetic approach to these pairing sessions . If the person we pair with recognizes the effort you put forth towards being helpful to them , they most likely will do the same for you .
