	<h3><center>Asking the Right Questions</center> </h3>
<body>
<p>

<p>During my the course of my studies while learning to become a developer I am constantly questioning. I question how to provide the correct output. I question whether or not it is possible to accomplish something with the type of code I am using. I question if there is an easier way to accomplish a complex function. I question if I am being provided accurate information. Out of any question I may have, the biggest one is often whether or not I am even asking the right one. With an almost infinite amount of complexities integrated within any given code, trying to clearly identify the issue I am having and then formulate a question that will yield the answer I am looking for can at times be not so easy . 
</p> 
<p>Prior to actually having to ask someone a programming question I often do a few things. First and foremost I turn to Google search.  I always look to Google first because I know that no matter how big or how small a question may be, Google will never get frustrated with me. Often times it is through the multiple searches that I go through that , if I dont find an answer immediately, I am  able to narrow down my question to exactly what I am looking for. If Google searches are not getting me anywhere, the next thing I do is try to identify names of the types of code I am working with. The reason I do this is because it allows me modify my search criteria so that it is more applicable to the current code. 
</p> 
<p>Ultimately there will and has come a time when I can't answer a question through researching on my own and will ask it on some forum. From my own experience, it has always worked best for me to provide some background about the question I have and if possible provide an example. Although it may make my question seem lengthy , it helps whoever I am asking the question to understand the problem I am encountering and what steps I have undertaken to resolve them. Without providing this kind of information the answer I receive may indeed answer the question I asked, but it may not be what I am looking for . For instance,  someone may ask the question  , "How do I create a function that calculates the sum of two known numbers using Ruby ?". This question is very specific and would most likely receive a couple of answers as to how this can be accomplished . However, what would happen if that question was being asked so that the answer could be inserted into a string of words? The output of the function may be correct , but if it was used within a string an  error would most likely result. In this scenario the question is being answered correctly, but without additional information that answer would not suffice and may lead to even more questions.

 When learning any new subject there will no doubtfully be many questions to be asked. In order to avoid becoming overwhelmed by them, it is important to prepare them so that they are formulated to receive an answer that you actually need. Remember that having questions can be frustrating for those that have them , but can be even more frustrating for others to whom the questions are asked. Doing a little research beforehand can help get sufficient answers to your questions quickly and may even reveal themselves in the process.

 	Now ponder this - What do you make of the question : Is there such thing as a stupid question ? If it is in itself a question? OOOooooooo :>
