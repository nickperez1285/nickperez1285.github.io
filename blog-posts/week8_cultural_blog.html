	<h3>Conflict Management </h3>
<body>
<p>
Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
 Dealing with emotional conflicts  is always tough for anyone. For me , I try to be as empathic as possible so that I can gain a clear understanding of what the other person is feeling and possibly come up with a way to mediate the conflict. I recall one situation a few years back while I was attending a meeting in Chicago about a new startup that I was about to take part of. During the meeting, the CEO had made several demeaning remarks about the programmers that were working on the website for the startup (,for free,) and placed most of the blame on the lead developer - my roommate. I had not let on to the fact that I was roommates with him so I let them speak their true thoughts about my roommate and his team without interruption. They claimed that the developers were incompetent, lazy, and unreliable. 

What was the source of the conflict?
The source of the conflict stemmed from the communication between the business team and the programming team. They both had ideas of what was needed , but had completely different understandings of how to go about it. Essentially neither one of the teams  could communicate to each other in a cohesive manner. 

How did you handle that conflict?
Half way through the meeting as they continued to make false assumptions about my roommate, I stood up and reintroduced myself as being the developers roommate. I expressed to everyone in the room that I wasn't mad or that I took offense to anything said, but that I did feel the need to clarify what I perceived was going on . I tried to explain things from both sides. I told them that as programmers, these guys don't have a good understanding of what content is needed to fulfill business  expectations, and the business team didn't understand what the process of building a site and how you cannot constantly add major functionality changes  without expecting delays in the final product. 

Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
The actions I took made things work out great . There was a much better understanding between parties and things went smoother from then on 

If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
If I could have gone back to do something different I would have reminded the  CEO that he does not have the greatest understanding of the developer world and that if he had the chance to sell the company  , he should absolutely do it . (He turned down a 2 million dollar offer claiming he would settle for nothing less than 10 billion)

What did you learn from this experience?
When you understand something about a situation that someone else does not, dont be afraid to speak up and explain  what you know if it will help mediate a situation
