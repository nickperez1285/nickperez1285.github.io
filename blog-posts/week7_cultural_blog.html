	<h3>  Affirmation and Stereotype Threat </h3>
<body>
<p>
	The values that come to mind when recalling those times I have been happiest, proudest , or satisfied include : 
	compassion,Accomplishment,Affection,Close,relationships,Compassion,Control,Cooperation,Enthusiasm,Fairness,Growth,Honesty,Inspiration,Knowledge,Loyalty,Peace,Public,service,Security,Sophistication,Tranquility, and Will-power.

	Compassion is the most important of all of these values to me. It is a selfless value that forces one to put oneself in someone else's shoes . Doing so makes their qualms  our own and motivates us to do what we can to alleviate those qualms. If done succesfully, one helps make the other lives a little better. The more people we try to practice this act of compassion to , the more people around us become happier, the more happy the world around us becomes. Compassion leads us to make the lives of those around us better and by doing so helps to create the immediate world we surround ourselves with better as well. 

	On a scale from 1 - 5, 5 agreeing the most, I try to live my life up to the values listed above at a 5 . 

	The last topic someone asked for advice on was about forming genuine friendships 

	I feel morally strong when I think about my values. I defintely think it can help mediate a stereotype threat. 

	In general , whenever I feel down I try to think about someone who has it worst than myself and how they would feel in my position.  In terms of DBC, I would advise someone that if they feel down , think about what the future holds by being in this program and how other people, maybe even themself prior to the program, had little future prospects without DBC
