	<h2><center> Stereotype Threats</h2>
<body>
<p>
	<p>&nbsp;  A 'stereotype threat' is defined as the, "...risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group " and the consequences in entails. Generally speaking , it means that there can be negative outcomes when being mindful of a stereotype that someone is  typically generalized to possess. An example would be the classic stereotype that people that wear glasses are "nerds". The stereotype threat for someone that wears glasses and that believes in this false notion ,or is at least a  semi-believer in it, is that they may start to inherit and make real the  personalty traits that are are often associated with the "nerd" stereotype . Someone with glasses might actually believe to some extent that they are a "nerd " which may cause them to have low self-esteem or become more of an introvert even though they would not typically believe themselves as such. </p> 
	<p>&nbsp;In my own personal experience as an Asian American, I have encountered many people that automatically assume that I posses certain personality traits commonly associated with people like myself.Before getting to know me, often times people think that I am  good at math , an introvert, and passive. While I can't deny that I may have an enhanced ability to perform mathematical calculations, anyone that knows me can tell you that I am anything but anti-social and that I have no fear of interacting with people I don't know. I believe that these traits developed due to the environment I grew up in and are less attributed to innate causes. As a child, my parents emphasized learning math because of its practicality. Having lived in a multi-racial neighborhood, I was exposed to people of many races and saw everyone for who they were rather than what race they were.  These are the reasons I am the way I am . </p>

	<p>&nbsp;Fortunately for me , I have had the opportunity to travel the world and see the differences between predominately single ethnic areas versus multi-ethnic areas like my home - the Bay Area. Being able to observe these differences has broadened my perspective on why people tend to have stereotypes of each other and helped me to form my own thoughts on the matter. For me personally, I take a stance of empathy and realistic  understanding. Without knowing somebody, the only characteristics we can expect from a stranger are those that we commonly observe in our experiences with people similar to them. I believe that this is what leads people to have stereotypes if not just for some hateful ignorance. This is just part of our human nature. For example, if I go to a grocery store and see a soda that is colored orange, I automatically assume that it will posses a flavor similar to that of an orange. For all I know the soda might actually  be flavored like  beef jerky! While this scenario is highly unlikely, it demonstrates my point that stereotypes  are just generalizations (,although often negative ones,) that stem from our experience with people of similar backgrounds. </p> 

	<p>&nbsp; In my own life , even if I feel that someone has stereotyped me, I try my best not to let the stereotype threat alter anything about the way I act regardless if it reinforces the stereotype. I feel that a stereotype becomes a stereotype threat only when we allow it to affect us in a negative way ,then change the way we act in response to it. I am good at math because I studied it a lot while I was younger, not because I am Asian. I realize that most Asians possess this similar skill, but I am not going to downplay my ability just because this generalization is true. Only then would it truly be  a stereotype threat. I realize that I may or may not possess many traits that are common throughout people with my same background . Without getting to know me , I accept that people are automatically going to have some preconceived notions about my character. However, it is ultimately up to me to decide how people are going to portray me.</p> 

	 <p>&nbsp;When dealing with others and stereotypes , I do my absolute best not to be mindful of their race or gender. I realize that due to the existence of stereotypes that I might come across as offensive because I am not as sensitive to the subject. However, I believe that being as genuine as possible is more important and can create the most welcoming environment . I know that in my heart  I am a good person  and if people see that I am not trying to hide anything about myself , even if I may offend people at times, they will eventually see that I am a good person too. If people know that I am being honest no matter how insensitive  , they can trust that whatever feedback I give is going to be  accurate. They can also be assured that if I am being nice to them that I do not have any ulterior motive.</p>
